# Dataset Description
We are using [the Offensive Language Identification Dataset (OLID)](https://sites.google.com/site/offensevalsharedtask/olid), which contains a collection of 14,200 annotated English tweets using an annotation model. 

## Files
We splited the original dataset into train dataset, development dataset, and test dataset:
- `train.csv`: 0.8
- `dev.csv`: 0.1
- `test.csv`: 0.1

## Columns
- `id`: Unique id that identifies a tweet
- `tweet`: Original tweets
- `subtask_a`: Label of a tweet. There are 2 categories: 
	- (NOT) Not Offensive - This post does not contain offense or profanity.
	- (OFF) Offensive - This post contains offensive language or a targeted (veiled or direct) offense
